## üìã Tasks Overview

### üîç Task 1: Third-Order Letter Approximation Model

#### **Overview**
Implement a **third-order letter approximation model** that analyzes five plain-text works from Project Gutenberg. This model counts the occurrences of every three-character sequence (trigram) in the cleaned text, providing insights into the frequency of specific letter sequences.

#### **Project Gutenberg Works**
- **Selection Criteria:**
  - Plain Text UTF-8 format.
  - Contains only ASCII characters: letters, spaces, and full stops.
- **File Naming:** `file1`, `file2`, `file3`, `file4`, `file5` for streamlined usage.

#### **Function Descriptions**

1. **`load_and_clean_text(file_paths)`**
   - **Purpose:** Loads multiple text files, removes unwanted characters, and converts all characters to uppercase.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `file_paths` (List[str]): Paths to the Project Gutenberg text files.
   - **Returns:** `str` ‚Äì A cleaned string ready for trigram analysis.

2. **`generate_trigrams(text)`**
   - **Purpose:** Creates a trigram model by counting every three-character sequence in the cleaned text.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `text` (str): Cleaned text for trigram extraction.
   - **Returns:** `Dict[str, int]` ‚Äì Dictionary with trigrams as keys and their counts as values.

3. **`display_top_trigrams(trigram_counts, n=100)`**
   - **Purpose:** Displays the top `n` most frequent trigrams.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `trigram_counts` (Dict[str, int]): Trigram frequency dictionary.
     - `n` (int, optional): Number of top trigrams to display. *(Default: 100)*
   - **Displays:** Top `n` trigrams directly in the console.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Task 2: Third-Order Letter Approximation Generation

#### **Overview**
Extend the trigram model from Task 1 to generate a 10,000-character-long string. The model predicts the next character based on the frequency of trigrams, following the patterns identified in the cleaned text.

#### **Function Descriptions**

1. **`generate_next_char(trigram_counts, prev_two_chars)`**
   - **Purpose:** Predicts the next character based on the previous two characters using the trigram model.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `trigram_counts` (Dict[str, int]): Trigram frequencies from Task 1.
     - `prev_two_chars` (str): The preceding two characters in the current sequence.
   - **Returns:** `str` ‚Äì The predicted next character.

2. **`generate_text(trigram_counts, length=10000)`**
   - **Purpose:** Generates a lengthy string by iteratively predicting the next character.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `trigram_counts` (Dict[str, int]): Trigram frequency dictionary.
     - `length` (int, optional): Desired length of the generated text. *(Default: 10,000 characters)*
   - **Returns:** `str` ‚Äì Generated text of specified length.

### üìà Task 3: Analyze Your Model

#### **Overview**
Assess the quality of the generated text by calculating the percentage of valid English words. This analysis provides insight into the model's ability to produce coherent language sequences.

#### **Function Descriptions**

1. **`load_word_list(file_path)`**
   - **Purpose:** Loads a list of valid English words from a specified file.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `file_path` (str): Path to `words.txt`, containing valid English words.
   - **Returns:** `Set[str]` ‚Äì Set of uppercase English words.

2. **`calculate_percentage_of_real_words(generated_text, valid_words)`**
   - **Purpose:** Calculates the percentage of valid English words in the generated text.
   - **Parameters:**
     - `generated_text` (str): Text generated by the trigram model.
     - `valid_words` (Set[str]): Set of valid English words.
   - **Returns:** `float` ‚Äì Percentage of valid English words in the generated text.

---

### üíæ Task 4: Export Model as JSON File

#### **Overview**
Export the trigram model created in Task 1 to a JSON file. This enables future access to the model data or integration with other projects.

#### **Function Description**

- **`export_trigram_model_to_json(trigram_counts, filename='trigram.json')`**
  - **Purpose:** Exports the trigram model to a JSON file.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `trigram_counts` (Dict[str, int]): Trigram model to export.
    - `filename` (str, optional): Name of the JSON file. *(Default: `trigram.json`)*
  - **Result:** Trigram model saved as a JSON file in the specified location.

## ü§ñ ELIZA Chatbot

## **Overview**
The **ELIZA Chatbot** is a web-based conversational program inspired by Joseph Weizenbaum's early natural language processing model. It simulates human-like conversations by analyzing user input and responding with dynamic, pre-programmed responses. Designed with a modern interface and interactive capabilities, ELIZA offers an engaging user experience.

## ‚ú® **Features and Testing Guide**

### 1. **Dynamic Sentiment Analysis**
ELIZA detects and categorizes the user's emotional state (positive, negative, or neutral) based on input, enhancing response relevance.
- **Test Positive Sentiment:**  
  Type: `I am excited`  
  Expected Response: *"That's great to hear! What has you feeling excited?"*
  
- **Test Negative Sentiment:**  
  Type: `I am feeling stressed`  
  Expected Response: *"Stress can be overwhelming. What's contributing to your stress?"*
  
- **Test Neutral Sentiment:**  
  Type: `I am fine`  
  Expected Response: *"I see. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?"*

---

### 2. **Synonym Recognition**
ELIZA can recognize synonyms of commonly used words or phrases, improving understanding and interaction quality.  
- **Greeting Synonym:**  
  Type: `Howdy`  
  Expected Response: *"Hello! How are you feeling today?"*  
- **Emotion Synonym:**  
  Type: `I feel blue`  
  Expected Response: *"I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about what's making you feel this way?"*

This is achieved using a robust synonym map that matches variations like "blue" to "sad" or "howdy" to "hello."

---

### 3. **Interactive Conversations**
ELIZA creates meaningful exchanges by analyzing context and patterns in input.  
- **Discuss a Goal:**  
  Type: `I want to learn coding`  
  Expected Response: *"What steps do you think you can take toward achieving 'learn coding'?"*  
- **Ask a Question:**  
  Type: `Why do people feel lonely?`  
  Expected Response: *"What are your thoughts on why people feel lonely?"*

---

### 4. **Contextual Memory**
ELIZA remembers user details, like names and emotions, to make conversations feel more personal.  
- **Provide Name:**  
  Type: `My name is Alex`  
  Expected Response: *"It's a pleasure to meet you, Alex. How has your day been so far?"*  
- **Emotion Tracking:**  
  After typing `I am happy`, type `Why do I feel like this?`  
  Expected Response: *"Let's explore why you feel that way."*

---

### 5. **Responsive Date and Time Information**
ELIZA dynamically fetches and provides the current date or time when asked.  
- **Ask for Time:**  
  Type: `What time is it?`  
  Expected Response: *"The current time is HH:MM AM/PM."*  
- **Ask for Date:**  
  Type: `What's today's date?`  
  Expected Response: *"Today's date is MM/DD/YYYY."*

---

### 6. **Default Response for Unrecognized Input**
When ELIZA doesn't understand the input, it encourages the user to elaborate.  
- **Test Unrecognized Input:**  
  Type: `asdfghjkl`  
  Expected Response: *"Please, tell me more about that."*

---

### 7. **Reset Chat**
Clear the conversation history to start fresh.
- **Reset the Chat:**  
  Click the Reset button in the header.  
  Expected Behavior: The chat history should clear, leaving the interface ready for a new conversation.
