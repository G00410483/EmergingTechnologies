## TASK 1: Third-Order Letter Approximation Model

### Overview
This project implements a third-order letter approximation model using five plain-text works from Project Gutenberg. 
The purpose of this model is to count the occurances of every three-character sequence in the cleaned text of these books.
The model can provide insights into frequency of specific letter sequences. 

### Project Gutenberg Works
- Five English works from Project Gutenberg are selected, ensuring that they:
  - Are in Plan Text UTF-8 format.
  - Do not contain any special characters outside the ASCII range (only letters, spaces, and full stops are allowed).
- Files named: file1, file2, file3, file4, file5 for easier usage.

### Function Descriptions:
#### 1. load_and_clean_text(file_paths)
   - Loads mutiple text files, removes unwated characters, and converts all characters to uppercase.
   - Cleans the text by retaining only alphabetic characters, full stops, and spaces.
   - Paramater: file_paths - A list of file paths to the Project Gunteberg text files.
   - Returns: A cleaned string ready for trigram analysis.
  
#### 2. generate_tigrams(text)
   - Generates a trigram model by counting the occurances of every three-characters sequneces in the cleaned text.
   - Parameter: text - The cleaned string of text from which to extract trigrams.
   - Returns: A dictionary where the keys are trigrams and the values are their respective counts.
  
#### 3. display_top_trigrams(trigram_counts, n = 100)
   - Displays the top n most frequent trigrams from the trigram model.
   - Parameters:
     - trigram_counts - The dictionary of trigrams and their counts generated by generate_trigrams().
     - n - The number of top trigrams to display.
   - Displays: Displays the result directly.

## TASK 2: Third-order letter approximation generation

### Overview:
This task extends trigram model from Task 1 by generating string based on the frequency of trigrams generated from the cleaned text. In task 2, the goal is to predict the next character in sequence and to generate 10,000 character long string that follows the patterns. 

### Function Descriptions:
#### 1. generate_next_char(trigram_counts, prev_two_chars)
   - This function predicts the next character based on the previous two characters by looking up trigrams that start with those two characters and randomly choosing the third character weighted by their frequency in the model.
   - Parameters:
     - trigram_counts (dict): The dictionary of trigrams and their frequencies, generated in Task 1.
     - prev_two_chars (str): A two-character string that represents the previous two characters in the current sequence.
   - Returns: The predicted next character based on the trigram model.
     
#### 2. generate_text(trigram_counts, length=10000)
   - This function generates a long string of text by repeatedly predicting the next character based on the previous two characters, starting with 'TH'.
   - Parameters:
     - trigram_counts (dict): The trigram frequency dictionary from Task 1.
     - length (int, optional): The desired length of the generated text (default is 10,000 characters).
   - Returns: A generated string of the specified length.

## TASK 3: Analyze Your Model

### Overview
The purpose of this task is to assess the quality of the generated text by calculating the percentage of valid English words within it, giving insight into model's ability to produce coherent language sequences. In Task 3, the generated text from the trigram-based third order approximation model is analzyed to determine the percentage of valid English words. 

### Function DEscriptions:
#### 1. load_word_list(file_path)
  - This function loads a list of valid English words from the file specified by file_path. The words are converted to uppercase to match the case of generated text.
  - Parameters: file_path (str): Path to words.txt, the file containg valid English words.
  - Returns: A set of words, all in uppercase.
    
#### 2. calculate_percentage_of_real_words(generated_text, valid_words)
  - This function calculates the percentage of valid English words within the generated text by checking each word against the loaded list of valid words.
  - Parameters:
      - generated_text (str): The generated text by trigram model.
      - valid_words (set): A set of valid English words loaded from words.txt.
  - Returns: A float representing the percetage of valid ENglish words in the generated text.
