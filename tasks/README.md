TASK 1: Third-Order Letter Approximation Model

Overview
This project implements a third-order letter approximation model using five plain-text works from Project Gutenberg. 
The purpose of this model is to count the occurances of every three-character sequence in the cleaned text of these books.
The model can provide insights into frequency of specific letter sequences. 

Files in the project:
- Main Script:
   - load_and_clean_text() - Loads and cleans the text data from provided files.
   - generate_tirgrams() - Create a trigram model by counting occurances of three-character sequences.
   - display_top_trigrams() - Display the top N most frequent trigrams.
- Text Files:
   - The script uses five free English works from Project Gutenberg in Plain Text UTF-8 format.

Project Gutenberg Works
- Five English works from Project Gutenberg are selected, ensuring that they:
  - Are in Plan Text UTF-8 format.
  - Do not contain any special characters outside the ASCII range (only letters, spaces, and full stops are allowed).
- Files named: file1, file2, file3, file4, file5 for easier usage.

Function Descriptions:
1. load_and_clean_text(file_paths)
   - Loads mutiple text files, removes unwated characters, and converts all characters to uppercase.
   - Cleans the text by retaining only alphabetic characters, full stops, and spaces.
   - Paramater: file_paths - A list of file paths to the Project Gunteberg text files.
   - Returns: A cleaned string ready for trigram analysis.
  
2. generate_tigrams(text)
   - Generates a trigram model by counting the occurances of every three-characters sequneces in the cleaned text.
   - Parameter: text - The cleaned string of text from which to extract trigrams.
   - Returns: A dictionary where the keys are trigrams and the values are their respective counts.
  
3. display_top_trigrams(trigram_counts, n = 100)
   - Displays the top n most frequent trigrams from the trigram model.
   - Parameters:
     - trigram_counts - The dictionary of trigrams and their counts generated by generate_trigrams().
     - n - The number of top trigrams to display.
   - Displays: Displays the result directly.
